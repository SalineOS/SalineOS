Description: Yet another dialog 
 is a fork of Zenity with many improvements, such as custom buttons,
 additional dialogs, pop-up menu in notification icon and more.
 There were two main reasons to make this fork. The first one
 is to remove dependencies on deprecated libraries, such as
 libglade and gnome canvas. And the second one as for me, Zenity 
 looks like an abandoned project. Its ChangeLog consists of just 
 "bump version to" and "translation updated" for the long time,
 but many interesting ideas which are ignored by
 developers/maintainers were in GNOME Bugzilla.
