export INFOTEXT="SOS Firewall is designed to be an easy and painless front-end to the Linux firewall system iptables. By default all incoming connections will be silently dropped, and all outgoing connections will be allowed. SOS Firewall is meant for machines that will have only one network connection active at any given time, and where simplicity is more important than fine grained control. For more advanced use cases, it is advised to disable SOS Firewall and install the Firestarter firewall utility.\n\nSOS Firewall will protect each and every physical network device, even if that interface is not connected to the internet. Simply put, this means that it does not matter to SOS Firewall what device is connected to the internet or if a device is connected at all, it will apply the same rules universally and automatically (Unless disabled)."
