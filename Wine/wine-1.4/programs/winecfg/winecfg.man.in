.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "winecfg"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B winecfg
is the Wine configuration editor. It allows you to change several settings, such as DLL load order
(native versus builtin), enable a virtual desktop, setup disk drives, and change the Wine audio driver,
among others. Many of these settings can be made on a per application basis, for example, preferring native
riched20.dll for wordpad.exe, but not for notepad.exe.
