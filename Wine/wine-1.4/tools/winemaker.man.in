.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B winemaker
is a perl script designed to help you bootstrap the
process of converting your Windows sources to Winelib programs.
.PP
In order to do this winemaker can perform the following operations:
.PP
- rename your source files and directories to lowercase in the event they
got all uppercased during the transfer.
.PP
- perform Dos to Unix (CRLF to LF) conversions.
.PP
- scan the include statements and resource file references to replace the
backslashes with forward slashes.
.PP
- during the above step winemaker will also perform a case insensitive search
of the referenced file in the include path and rewrite the include statement
with the right case if necessary.
.PP
- winemaker will also check other more exotic issues like '#pragma pack'
usage, use of "afxres.h" in non MFC projects, and more. Whenever it
encounters something out of the ordinary, winemaker will warn you about it.
.PP
- winemaker can also scan a complete directory tree at once, guess what are
the executables and libraries you are trying to build, match them with
source files, and generate the corresponding Makefile.
.PP
- finally winemaker will generate a global Makefile for normal use.
.PP
- winemaker knows about MFC-based project and will generate customized files.
.PP
- winemaker can read existing project files. It supports dsp, dsw, vcproj and sln files.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --nobanner
Disables the printing of the banner.
.TP
.B --backup
Directs winemaker to perform a backup of all the source files in which it
makes changes. This is the default.
.TP
.B --nobackup
Tells winemaker not to backup modified source files.
.TP
.B --nosource-fix
Directs winemaker not to try fixing the source files (e.g. Dos to Unix
conversion). This prevents complaints if the files are readonly.
.TP
.B --lower-all
Tells winemaker to rename all files and directories to lowercase.
.TP
.B --lower-uppercase
Tells winemaker to only rename files and directories that have an all
uppercase name.
So "HELLO.C" would be renamed but not "World.c".
.TP
.B --lower-none
Tells winemaker not to rename files and directories to lower case. Note
that this does not prevent the renaming of a file if its extension cannot
be handled as is, e.g. ".Cxx". This is the default.
.TP
.B "--lower-include "
Tells winemaker that if it does not find the file corresponding to an
include statement (or other form of file reference for resource files),
then it should convert that filename to lowercase. This is the default.
.TP
.B "--nolower-include "
Tells winemaker not to modify the include statement if it cannot find the
referenced file.
.TP
.BR "--guiexe " "| " "--windows"
Specifies that whenever winemaker finds an executable target, or a target of
unknown type, it should assume that it is a graphical application.
This is the default.
.TP
.BR "--cuiexe " "| " "--console"
Specifies that whenever winemaker finds an executable target, or a target of
unknown type, it should assume that it is a console application.
.TP
.B --dll
This option tells winemaker that whenever it finds a target of unknown type,
i.e. for which it does not know whether it is an executable, a dll, or a static library,
it should assume it is a dll.
.TP
.B --lib
This option tells winemaker that whenever it finds a target of unknown type,
i.e. for which it does not know whether it is an executable, a dll, or a static library,
it should assume it is a static library.
.TP
.B --mfc
Specifies that the targets are MFC based. In such a case winemaker adapts
the include and library paths accordingly, and links the target with the
MFC library.
.TP
.B --nomfc
Specifies that targets are not MFC-based. This option disables use of MFC libraries
even if winemaker encounters files "stdafx.cpp" or "stdafx.h" that would cause it
to enable MFC automatically if neither --nomfc nor --mfc was specified.
.TP
.BI -D macro "\fR[=\fIdefn\fR]"
Adds the specified macro definition to the global list of macro definitions.
.TP
.BI -I dir
Appends the specified directory to the global include path.
.TP
.BI -P dir
Appends the specified directory to the global dll path.
.TP
.BI -i dll
Adds the Winelib library to the global list of Winelib libraries to import.
.TP
.BI -L dir
Appends the specified directory to the global library path.
.TP
.BI -l library
Adds the specified library to the global list of libraries to link with.
.TP
.B --nodlls
This option tells winemaker not to use the standard set of winelib libraries
for imports. That is, any DLL your code uses must be explicitly passed to
winemaker with -i options.
The standard set of libraries is: odbc32.dll, odbccp32.dll, ole32.dll,
oleaut32.dll and winspool.drv.
.TP
.B --nomsvcrt
Sets some options to tell winegcc not to compile against msvcrt.
Use this option if you have cpp-files that include <string>.
.TP
.B --interactive
Puts winemaker in interactive mode. In this mode winemaker will ask you to
confirm each directory's list of targets, and then to provide directory and
target specific options.
.TP
.BR --single-target " name"
Specifies that there is only one target, and that it is called "name".
.TP
.B --generated-files
Tells winemaker to generate the Makefile. This is the default.
.TP
.B --nogenerated-files
Tells winemaker not to generate the Makefile.
.TP
.B --wine32
Tells winemaker to generate a 32-bit target. This is useful on wow64 systems.
Without that option the default architecture is used.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Here is a typical winemaker use:
.PP
$ winemaker --lower-uppercase -DSTRICT .
.PP
The above tells winemaker to scan the current directory and its
subdirectories for source files. Whenever if finds a file or directory which
name is all uppercase, it should rename it to lowercase. It should then fix
all these source files for compilation with Winelib and generate Makefiles.
The '-DSTRICT' specifies that the STRICT macro must be set when compiling
these sources. Finally winemaker will create a Makefile.
.PP
The next step would be:
.PP
$ make
.PP
If at this point you get compilation errors (which is quite likely for a
reasonably sized project) then you should consult the Winelib User Guide to
find tips on how to resolve them.
.PP
For an MFC-based project you would have to run the following commands instead:
.PP
$ winemaker --lower-uppercase --mfc .
.br
$ make
.PP
For an existing project-file you would have to run the following commands:
.PP
$ winemaker myproject.dsp
.br
$ make
.PP

.SH TODO / BUGS
.PP
In some cases you will have to edit the Makefile or source files by yourself.
.PP
Assuming that the windows executable/library is available, we could
use winedump to determine what kind of executable it is (graphical
or console), which libraries it is linked with, and which functions it
exports (for libraries). We could then restore all these settings for the
corresponding Winelib target.
.PP
Furthermore winemaker is not very good at finding the library containing the
executable: it must either be in the current directory or in the
.IR LD_LIBRARY_PATH .
.PP
Winemaker does not support message files and the message compiler yet.
